# 0.7.4

Stability and refactoring release.

## Fixed

- `parseCached` now correctly delegates to `parseCachedWithDiagnostics` instead of silently swallowing exceptions

## Changed

- Improved stable block keys for lists, quotes, tables, footnotes — reduces unnecessary recompositions in `LazyColumn`
- Extracted shared HTML utilities to `OrcaHtmlUtils`, removed duplication between block and inline renderers
- Removed redundant `mergeAdjacentText` call before footnote processing

## Upgrade

```kotlin
implementation("ru.wertik:orca-core:0.7.4")
implementation("ru.wertik:orca-compose:0.7.4")
```

No API changes. Drop-in replacement for 0.7.3.
